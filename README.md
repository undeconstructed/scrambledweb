# scrambled web

This is two things:

* A clone of an Android game called Scrambled Net, which is not updated anymore
and doesn't scale well to my screen size.

* An experiment in writing JavaScript in a way that is not surprising. There's
a tiny custom class system, with the very least magic possible, all state is
explicitly captured and passed, there's a public API on objects, etc.
